Let me start by understanding the job posting and looking through Yu-Yan's resume.\n\nFirst, the position mentions a full-stack software engineer role at Proofpoint as being the leader developer of their serverless application using Java and Golang with Kubernetes. They have experience in leading teams, implementing security measures, and optimizing system performance. This suggests they're highly experienced in building scalable applications, especially on Kubernetes, which aligns well with the company's needs.\n\nLooking at their resume, Yu-Yan has several relevant entries. They led a team of five engineers to develop a distributed data platform for AEM instances on AEM author instances, which directly ties into the full-stack role mentioned in the job posting. Their technical skills include ETL pipelining, Sling filters for event interception, and building microservices across multiple platforms. This shows they can manage large-scale systems effectively.\n\nAlso, their experience with React UI components using Adobe Micro-frontend suggests they have JavaScript proficiency, which is relevant for server-side applications often part of full-stack environments.
